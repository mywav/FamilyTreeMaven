# FamilyTreeMaven
Make a list of people and their children and this program will create a family tree

I included a sample text file that resembles a file you would have to create of your relatives or whoever you want to add to the program.
You list on the first line the number of people that will be analyzed.
On each line thereafter you list the name of a person and then list all their children. 
As long as the names are all different from each other this program will create a family tree representation of the lineage.
If you have two people with the same name, distinguish them like, "JohnJr" or "JohnDoeSenior" etc.
